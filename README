Since starting my job hunt I have seen a number of companies have moved to ReactJS for there front end develiopment work.
Because of this I decided to learn how to use it.

The first project I created was a simple about me page that used ReactJS to display information about myself. 
For this page I used babel to help me program with ease.

At the start of the project I created a number of variables which contain numerous pieces of information. 
This allowed me to change any piece of information in a quick and easy way.

After that I created numerous functions which would get and show the components on the page as well as set up HTML tags if I wish for the information
to be set up in a specific way.

An example of this is the components which contain my phone number as well as the programing languages I worked with. 
For these in the functions that display them I set up the HTML <p> tag to diaplay them as a paragraph.

After The Information functions were created and set-up. I had one final function that would show and display my information, and used ReactDom.render to
control how the contents of the node is shown.

Alongside using ReactJS I also used Twitter's API to display the recent Tweets that I have shared on my profile as well as create a menu at the 
bottom of the page that links to other websites.
